## Usage

### Use `--help`

To make the most out of the `gwa` tool, you can use the `--help` command to get detailed information on its various commands and options. Here's how you can use it:

#### Basic Usage of `--help`
The `--help` flag can be used with any command within the `gwa` tool to display information about that command, including its purpose, options, and examples.

1. **General Help**: To get an overview of all available commands, simply run:
    ```sh
       gwa --help
    ```
    This will list all the primary commands and provide a brief description of each.
       
2. **Command-Specific Help**: To get detailed information about a specific command, use `--help` with the command in question. For example, if you want to learn more about the gateway command, you can run:
    ```sh
       gwa gateway --help
    ```
    This will provide detailed information about the gateway command, including its syntax, options, and examples.
