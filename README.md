`gwa` is a tool for composing, validating and publishing Gateway configuration files to the BC Government's [API Services Portal](https://api.gov.bc.ca).

## Installation

To get started with `gwa`, follow the detailed instructions provided in the DevHub [installation](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/aps-infra-platform-docs/how-to/gwa-install/) guide.

## Usage

### Use `--help`

To make the most out of the `gwa` tool, you can use the `--help` option to get detailed information on its various commands and options. Here's how you can use it:

1. **General Help**: To get an overview of all available commands, run:
    ```sh
       gwa --help
    ```
    This will list all the primary commands and provide a brief description of each.
       
2. **Command-Specific Help**: To get detailed information about a specific command, use `--help` with the command in question. For example, if you want to learn more about the `gateway` command, you can run:
    ```sh
       gwa gateway --help
    ```
    This will provide detailed information about the `gateway` command, including its syntax, options, and examples.

### Online documentation

Explore `gwa` commands in an easy-to-read reference format on the DevHub [CLI commands page](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/docs/default/component/aps-infra-platform-docs/reference/gwa-commands/).

The content on this page is the same as the `--help` output.
