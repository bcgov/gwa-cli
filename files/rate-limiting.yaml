  Rate limit how many HTTP requests can be made in a given period of seconds, minutes, hours, days, months, or years. If the underlying Service/Route (or deprecated API entity) has no authentication layer, the Client IP address will be used, otherwise the Consumer will be used if an authentication plugin has been configured.
